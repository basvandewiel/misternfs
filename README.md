# misternfs
NFS support for MiSTer. This repository contains supporting scripts for use once the
MiSTer's Linux kernel gets NFS client support compiled in.

The script is based off the CIFS scripts already present in the project and modifications
as made by misterfpga.org user RealLarry.

The purpose of this repository is to eventually disappear so that the script can be adopted
into the mainline MiSTer project and live on there.
